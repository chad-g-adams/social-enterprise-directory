      "description" : "15 years ago, Zambian Canadian Dan Ball went into a remote forest to work with two dozen beekeepers. Today they have trained over 10,000 beekeepers and exported 1,200 tons of organic bulk honey to Europe last year. Longtime friend Dan asked us to develop a retail market in North America to help value add their honey and create additional sustainable profit to train more beekeepers. This is the African Bronze Honey Company.",

      "description" : "Launched in 2009, Beads of Awareness currently works with over 50 artisans in the Gulu region of Northern Uganda. We buy paper bead necklaces, bracelets, earrings, bookmarks and ornaments from women's groups at a fair price that enables them to support their families. Our proceeds are reinvested in a micro-finance initiative that offers small loans to the same women, empowering them to build and grow micro-enterprises to supplement their income. In Canada we are entirely volunteer run, and in Uganda we have two local staff to manage our operations on the ground.",
